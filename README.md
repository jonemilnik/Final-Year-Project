# 6CCS3PRJ Individual Project - Unity's A.I. Planner vs Behaviour Trees
---
Unity version: 2020.3.21f1

This is a stealth based game where the agent is the player and is implemented using either:
- Unity's A.I. Planner
- Finite State Machine
## Base Game
Stealthy agent is given a path with a goal location to reach. Along the path there are bins which provide cover for
the agent to avoid being detected by cyclic patrolling agents. The aim of the game is to reach the goal location 
without being detected.

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to evaluate common reactive approaches (behaviour trees) to deliberative ones (planner).
There are 3 testing-configuration scenes of the game for each of the agents. These can be found in the scenes folder. 

##Fixing errors
You may encounter random error logs that come up after the unity project has been open for a while. A simple program restart is enough to fix the issue. If it still persists, consider restarting your computer.
